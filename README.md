## Setup

Clone this GitHub repo: [https://github.com/rben01/covid19](https://github.com/rben01/covid19)

To create these graphs, create the conda environment using

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the environment with

```bash
conda activate covid
```

Finally, run the graphing script

```bash
python src/case_tracker.py
```

## Data sources

- [Washington Post world historical data](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/mapping-spread-new-coronavirus/data/clean/world-daily-historical.csv)
- [covidtracking.com US states historical data](https://covidtracking.com/api/states/daily.csv)
- [Wikipedia - List of Countries by Population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population)

## Notes

- üìÖ In all graphs below, the start date was the earliest date for which there was data available and for which any of the plotted locations had confirmed cases [text](#Contents)

- üîü In each graph, the "top 10" refers to top 10 by number of cases, even for the graphs of cases per capita. Graphs' legends are, however, sorted according to the relevant measurement (number of cases or cases per capita).
For example, in a graph of countries and their cases per capita, the first country in the legend will have the most cases per capita of all countries included in that graph, but not necessarily the most cases per capita of any country in the world (the country with the most cases per capita in the world ‚Äî San Marino at the time of writing ‚Äî would have to be in the top 10 by number of cases to make it onto the graph, which it's obviously not given its population of 33k).

- üîÑ The data sources used will change frequently due to changing quality and up-to-dateness, which may affect data for past dates (it shouldn't, but it might)

- üìù Mortality notes

  - Mortality = deaths / confirmed.
  - This is an underestimate of the true mortality rate within a region; how low of an estimate it is depends on how quickly the rate of new confirmed cases relative to existing confirmed cases (the slopes of the lines in the below log-scaled plots) is increasing. If the infection rate increases rapidly, the computed mortality rate will be a gross underestimate, as new infections won't yet have had time to become fatal. If it's been flat for a while, then the computed mortality rate should approach the true mortality rate, as cases will all be resolved (either fatally or not). Of course, the true mortality rate can itself change over time as treatment quality goes up (e.g.,  more resources per capita allocated to response) or down (e.g.,  hospitals become overburdened).

  - The nature of log-scale graphs is that the mortality rate can be observed from the vertical distance between the **Confirmed Cases** and **Deaths** lines for a given country ‚Äî the larger the distance, the lower the mortality rate. (The computed mortality rate is roughly (1/2)^distance; again this will be an underestimate.)
